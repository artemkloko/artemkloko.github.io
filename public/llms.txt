## Preferences

**Position:** I am looking for a Senior or Lead position. I love coding and driving the full development cycle of any feature forward, i.e. gathering requirements, setting up cross-team communication channels, writing proposals, scoping, estimating, planning, grooming, shipping and measuring the impact of each deployment, no matter if the feature is frontend, backend, or full-stack. I am also interested in leading and helping team members evolve, as I strongly believe that effective work and innovation can only be achieved by a team of engaged, diverse and responsible people.

**Location:** I am open to remote, hybrid, and on-site positions. I am based in Berlin, Germany, but sometimes I need to travel for family or professional reasons.

**Employment type:** I am open to full-time permanent employment, as well as short-term and long-term freelance or contractor projects.

**Work samples:** Please visit my GitHub account if you want to check out some of my personal projects and open source contributions. Unfortunately a lot of the hard work I have done in the past is not open source and belongs to private companies, but upon the needs of collaboration, I can outline the technology stack and procedures that I used in the past.
